**Robotic Car**

A robotic car, primarily constructed for competition in COR Robotic Games and AC Robotic games, utilizing C language and Arduino hardware. 
The project involved meticulous planning and design of 2D and 3D components for laser cutting and 3D printing. 
Collaborating with a team of four, I played a key role in robot design, programming, and team leadership, leading us to second place at the AC Robotic Games.
